## Why Twitch
Twitch is a well known live streaming platform owned by Amazon. Many companies now use the platform to promote, document and market various products to the general public with the main product being video games.

Sadly, I've often found Twitch to be a top-heavy platform with the majority of views and subscriptions going towards the bigger streamers on the platform. This is where Stream Share Bot comes in, the idea is that it solely promotes smaller streamers to a community of smaller streamers to boost visibily and allow for networking opportunities.
